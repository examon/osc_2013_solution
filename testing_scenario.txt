# Testing scenario for https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1020191 

1. Install Cumin and all its dependencies according to the documentation. [https://fedorahosted.org/grid/wiki/Cumin]
2. [optional] Clear all /var/lib/condor/spool/* so we will have clear job list.
3. Start/Restart condor, cumin-data & cumin-web.
4. Open up browser and load the following url http://http://localhost:45672/index.html
5. Log in as an administrator.
6. Once logged in, click on the "Submissions" tab.
7. Submit at least 10 jobs by clicking at the "Submit job". The jobs must have identical "Description".
   - If you have condor-aviary installed you can submit jobs using the following script:

     #!/bin/sh
     export PYTHONPATH=/usr/share/condor/aviary/module
     /usr/share/condor/aviary/submit.py

8. Click on the entry you created in the Submissions table (e.g. if you called your job "test", click on the item "test").
   This will open the table of the all jobs you just created with the same "Description".
9. Check table items, they should be already ordered.
10. Sort items according to the Job id by clicking on the "Job id" link in the table header.
11. Check again (items should be sorted differently, e.g. in ascending/descending order).
